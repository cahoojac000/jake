          <p>Well for starters I'm Jacob Cahoon. I'm 16 years old and a junior at Lone Peak High School. Previously I attented Lincoln Academy. I started Lincoln as a kindergartner and ended as 9th grader.
             I did, however, switch schools during my second semester of 7th grade because my dad attainted a job in Luxembourg. It's a dope little country in Europe and I loved it there. We stayed there for one year; it was in 2014.
             The experiences and adventures I had there made me who I am today. My family traveled everywhere, so I got an extensive view of different lifestyles, cultures, educations, governments, social hierarchies, the world outside of
             our Utah County bubble. 
          </p>

            I'm a really physically active kid. During the school year, I'm on the Lone Peak mountain bike team and soccer team. During the summer, I bike like none other and play soccer for Utah Surf. Everyday I wake up at 6:00 and then I bike to soccer practice (2 miles),
            bike to Code To Success (15 miles), bike to work (3 miles), bike home (15 miles), and then go to mountain bike practice (15 - 30 miles). That adds up and takes a huge toll on my body, but it shows that I'm commited, follow through, and work hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Education-wise I'm in a good place. I'm on track to take 4 AP classes my junior year. Just the homework alone is going to eat up my free time, but I want to give myself the best opportunity to learn as much as I can and attent the college I want.
